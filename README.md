# The Forming

## What is this project?

This was my very first project outside of Hello Worlds etc. I had no concept of anything to do with OOP, version control,
design patterns, algorithms and data structures. Just basic ifs, fors, whiles and good old copying and pasting from
StackOverflow.

My intention was to create a small RPG using the PyGame library but I soon abandoned it. I keep stumbling upon it tho
and always tell myself to at least tidy it up. This is the first step towards that.

I guess I'll turn this into a measurement of how far I've come. I'll probably look back on this project in another 5 
years and contemplate what was going through my head at the time of writing this.
