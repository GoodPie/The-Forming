	[Graphics Update - Coming Soon]
	- I am currently redoing all the graphics in order to make it look a bit better.
	This will mean that everything is basically supersized to 64x64 (double the size it is now).
	The main player will be taller (not a square) and will have allot more detail.
	Trees will be taller, and again not square, providing realism. There will be drops
	from trees and other stuff (wheat, potatoes etc..). Also, map generation will change quite a bit.
	There will be two loops to draw the map. One for the background entities (ie; grass, sand, planks)
	and another for transparent backgrounded entities like wheat, logs, straw, trees etc...
	Frame rate will hopefully be increased as not every single image will be loaded. Armor for the character
	will be added.

	[Inventory Update - Coming Soon]
	- There will be a new inventory system. The same buttons will apply, but it will look allot neater.
	Drops will automatically be added to the inventory and ordered accordingly. The start inventory will
	contain nothing, and you will have to chop trees etc. In the desert biome, dead trees can be chopped
	for wood.

	[Better Biomes - Coming Soon]
	- Mixed biomes will hopefully be added, where we have a mixture of every biome.

	[Story + Dungeons - Coming Soon]
	- Adding the main story line alongside the free to play. Dungeons will be added to free play, meaning
	that you can explore caves and get extra loot. With the addition of dungeons comes villages and towns
	where you can trade your loot and buy new things.

	I am aware that this is quite allot, and I do have school coming again soon, so it may seem dead for a
	couple of days or perhaps weeks, but do note that I will always continue with the project of mine.
